* Optical Character Recognition is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of types, handwritten, or printed text into machine encoded text, whether from a scanned document , a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image
* Characters are recognized as:
    1. based on their models

* Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) reads hand-printed text using ```FineReader``` which uses special dictionaries to verify names,surnames, dates and addresses etc

* FlexiCapture is used to intelligently classify, extract, and serve critical data from incoming images and document streams to decision makers for better performance, document workflow process trasparency and workload predictability
* Fundamental data extraction operations are:
    1. Classification
    2. Optical Recognition
    3. Verification
    4. Export to ERP,ECM or BPM systems
